    "# Identifying Similar Images with Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Douglas Duhaime wrote an [excellent tutorial](http://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html). This notebook is my experiment trying to follow his steps, using a github repo and a jupyter binder.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it works...\n",
    "\n",
    "ok, so: I have a bunch of images in \\images (we're pulling from [this repo](https://github.com/shawngraham/bindr-test-Identifying-Similar-Images-with-TensorFlow)). In Duhaime's tutorial, he had a folder with 2000 images. I'm just going with 25 here because a) I'm impatient and b) I don't know how many I can push into github.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below all runs, but I'm not sure where the output is hiding...\n",
    "\n",
    "So. Install the needful things, run the modified classify script (which pulls out the second but last layer), and write it to the new `image_vectors` dir. Then cluster, then project."
